# Emoticon

This is my collection of "表情包" emoticons with a tiny server for BearyChat outgoing bot.

Forked from https://git.dev.tencent.com/kawaiiq/emoticon.git.

To start the server, just run script_predict.py. Notice that this repository has removed the pretrained model, so you have to run script_train.py first to train the classifier yourself.
